#Machine Learning Codecademy Projects 

This folder contains Machine learning projects showcasing various ML model applications


Project # 1 [Honey Bee Production - Linear Regression Model ]
Production of honey has been in decline, here we investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honey production using Linear Regression Model.

Project # 2 [ New York City’s Real Estate Marketplace : Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLR)]
 
Built a MLR model to analyse StreetEasy Dataset.

Street Easy is New York City’s leading real estate marketplace. The dataset contains information about apartments in New York. I’ll find the correlations between several features and the rent, build/evaluate a MLR model, and use the model to present interesting findings: 
“How costly is living by a subway station in Brooklyn/Queens?”
“Is a tenant over or underpaying?”
